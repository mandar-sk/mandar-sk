## Projects

> **Binomial_Tree_vs_Black_Scholes_for_Option_Pricing** `Feb 2025`
> - Compared the Greeks calculated by the Binomial Tree model and the Black-Scholes model, demonstrating how the Binomial Tree's results converge to those of the Black-Scholes as the number of steps in the tree increases. 
> - GitHub repository: **https://github.com/mandar-sk/Binomial_Tree_vs_Black_Scholes_for_option_pricing**

> **Beyond Credit Scores: A Predictive Model for Loan Defaults** `Jan 2025`
> - Developed a predictive model to assess the probability of loan default (“charge-off”) enabling data-driven risk assessment for lending decisions using Kaggle Lending Club's historical loan data with over 887K observations and 150 features.
> - Preprocessed and engineered features from the extensive dataset, addressing class imbalance via stratified sampling and reducing the feature space to 34 key variables (e.g., FICO score, loan term, income) for improved model performance.
> - Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, achieving 86% accuracy, an 87% F1-score, and a 93% AUC-ROC on validation data with a Gradient Boosting Classifier optimized through GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning.
> - Identified key risk predictors (interest rate, FICO scores, last payment amount, debt-to-income ratio, etc.) and delivered an interpretable model, improving loan approval decisions and mitigating financial risk by proactively identifying high-risk borrowers (91% recall) and minimizing missed opportunities with low-risk borrowers (89% precision).

> **E-commerce Intelligence: Harnessing ML & NLP for Consumer Segmentation and Product Recommendations** `Dec 2024`
> - Analyzed Amazon order histories to segment customers from high to low value using K-means clustering. Applied statistical techniques to uncover demographic influences on spending patterns, providing insights into targeted marketing strategies.
> - Implemented NLP techniques to categorize products based on their descriptions. Employed TF-IDF vectorizer and Word2Vec embedder with various classifiers. Achieved the highest validation accuracy with the integration of TF-IDF vectorization and a Linear SVM, enabling precise product classification critical for recommending the most relevant products to customers.

> **R-Based-Statistical-Distribution-Analysis-Toolkit** `Dec 2024`
> - Created a toolkit which offers a robust approach for analyzing sampling distributions across various statistical measures and distributions using R. It systematically explores the impact of distribution characteristics and sample sizes on the convergence to normality of sample statistics.
> - GitHub repository: **https://github.com/mandar-sk/R-Based-Statistical-Distribution-Analysis-Toolkit**

> **Real Estate Price Prediction and Recommendation System** `Nov 2024`
> - Developed an end-to-end real estate data science application, with data scraping from 99 Acres website, did meticulous data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA, to facilitate a deeper understanding of data distribution and structure.
> - Employed various statistical and machine learning methods including correlation analysis, permutation importance, LASSO, and SHAP values to identify the most impactful variables for precise modeling.
> - Conducted an exhaustive comparison of regression models including Linear Regression, SVR, and Gradient Boosting, ultimately deploying the most effective model via Streamlit on AWS for real-time user interaction.
> - Built 3 distinct recommendation models tailored to different real estate facets—facilities, pricing, and location advantages. Integrated a user-friendly recommendation interface, significantly improving accessibility and user experience.
     
> **Optimizing Portfolio Construction: A Comparative Analysis of Quadratic Programming and Monte Carlo Simulation** `Oct 2024`
> - Engineered a user-driven portfolio optimization tool leveraging Quadratic Programming & Dirichlet distributed Monte Carlo simulation to generate efficient frontiers based on historical data of Indian stocks.
> - This tool enables users to input their desired return or risk tolerance and provides an efficient diversified portfolio.
