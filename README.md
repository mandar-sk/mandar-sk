## Projects

> **Regression Modeling and Statistical Inference on Auction Price Determinants** 
> - Conducted exploratory and correlation analysis to study how clock age and number of bidders affect auction prices, using visualizations and statistical summaries in R.
> - Built and validated multiple regression models, checking significance through F-tests, t-tests, and confidence intervals, and compared partial vs. marginal correlations to interpret predictor importance.
> - Performed residual diagnostics and assumption tests (normality, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity), refined the model with an interaction term, and derived prediction intervals for practical insights.

> **E-commerce Intelligence: Harnessing ML & NLP for Consumer Segmentation and Product Recommendations** 
> - Analyzed Amazon order histories to segment customers from high to low value using K-means clustering. Applied statistical techniques to uncover demographic influences on spending patterns, providing insights into targeted marketing strategies.
> - Implemented NLP techniques to categorize products based on their descriptions. Employed TF-IDF vectorizer and Word2Vec embedder with various classifiers. Achieved the highest validation accuracy with the integration of TF-IDF vectorization and a Linear SVM, enabling precise product classification critical for recommending the most relevant products to customers.
