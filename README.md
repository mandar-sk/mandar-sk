## Projects

> **Machine Learning for Early Detection of Cardiac Dysfunction in Cancer Patients** 
> - Engineered a high-performance Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to detect early signs of cardiac dysfunction in cancer patients, achieving 99.5% accuracy and a 1.000 ROC-AUC score on a validation set of 220 patients.
> - Conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis on 17 echocardiographic parameters using non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U, Cliff's δ) to validate significant differences between 500 cancer and 600 control patients.
> - Implemented a model interpretation framework that identified Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Strain (LVGLS), LVEF, and RVGLS as the most critical predictors, providing clinically relevant insights for early cardiac risk assessment.

> **Binomial_Tree_vs_Black_Scholes_for_Option_Pricing** 
> - Compared the Greeks calculated by the Binomial Tree model and the Black-Scholes model, demonstrating how the Binomial Tree's results converge to those of the Black-Scholes as the number of steps in the tree increases. 
> - GitHub repository: **https://github.com/mandar-sk/Binomial_Tree_vs_Black_Scholes_for_option_pricing**

> **E-commerce Intelligence: Harnessing ML & NLP for Consumer Segmentation and Product Recommendations** 
> - Analyzed Amazon order histories to segment customers from high to low value using K-means clustering. Applied statistical techniques to uncover demographic influences on spending patterns, providing insights into targeted marketing strategies.
> - Implemented NLP techniques to categorize products based on their descriptions. Employed TF-IDF vectorizer and Word2Vec embedder with various classifiers. Achieved the highest validation accuracy with the integration of TF-IDF vectorization and a Linear SVM, enabling precise product classification critical for recommending the most relevant products to customers.
> - GitHub repository: **https://github.com/mandar-sk/Amazon-Customer-Segmentation-with-Machine-Learning-and-NLP**

> **R-Based-Statistical-Distribution-Analysis-Toolkit** 
> - Created a toolkit which offers a robust approach for analyzing sampling distributions across various statistical measures and distributions using R. It systematically explores the impact of distribution characteristics and sample sizes on the convergence to normality of sample statistics.
> - GitHub repository: **https://github.com/mandar-sk/R-Based-Statistical-Distribution-Analysis-Toolkit**

> **Optimizing Portfolio Construction: A Comparative Analysis of Quadratic Programming and Monte Carlo Simulation** 
> - Engineered a dynamic portfolio optimization tool leveraging Quadratic Programming & Dirichlet distributed Monte Carlo simulation to construct efficient frontiers based on historical stock market data. Created an interactive dashboard that allows investors to input risk tolerance or target return, providing optimized, diversified asset allocations tailored to financial goals.
> - Employed SML and CAPM to assess the portfolio’s expected return against Beta, validating a risk-adjusted strategy. Further Beta analysis ensures a balanced risk-return trade-off, enhancing portfolio efficiency over market benchmarks (NIFTY 50).
